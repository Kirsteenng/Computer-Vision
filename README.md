# Build a computer vision library

In this repository you will find instructions on how to build your own image processing/computer vision library from (mostly) scratch. The work is divided out into different homework assignments, found in the `src/` directory.

To get started, make sure you have `git`, a C compiler, and `make` installed. Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/UW-CSE-576-2022SP/Homework
cd Homework
make
```

and check to see that everything compiles correctly. We recommend using Linux or MacOS for the homework since installing `make` is easier. Linux uses GNU C++ compiler, while MacOS uses XCode C++ compiler.
